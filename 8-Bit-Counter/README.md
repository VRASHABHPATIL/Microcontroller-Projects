## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Design and implement a `8 bit` counter system using the `Atmega32` microcontroller. The objective is to create a system that displays a count value continuously on aseven-segment `display` or an `LCD`, accurately tracking and displaying the count value

## VIRTUAL IMPLEMENTATION

## CIRCUIT EXPLANATION

•**Atmega32**: The Atmega32 is a popular `8-bit microcontroller` from the `AVR` family developed by Atmel (now Microchip Technology). It features a `RISC architecture`, a wide range of peripherals, and is widely used in various applications due to its versatility, performance, and availability of development tools. It has `32KB of flash memor`y for program storage, `2KB of SRAM` for data storage, and various I/O ports for interfacing with external devices.

•A `7-segment` display is a simple electronic component used to represent numeric digits and some basic symbols. It consists of `seven individual LED (Light Emitting Diode)` segments arranged in a specific pattern to form the digit representation from `0 to 9` and a few `letters (A, B, C, D, E, F)` as well. These displays are widely used in various electronic devices, from digital clocks and calculators to microwave ovens and scoreboard display.
