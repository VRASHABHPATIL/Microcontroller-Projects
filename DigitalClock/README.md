## Digital Clock

### PROBLEM STATEMENT
Design a `digital clock` using a microcontroller that displays the current time on a `7-segment` display in minutes and seconds. The clock should be able to accurately keep track of time.

### CIRCUIT EXPLANATION
•**Atmega32**: The `Atmega32` is a popular `8-bit microcontroller` from the `AVR` family developed by Atmel (now Microchip Technology). It features a `RISC architecture`, a wide range of peripherals, and is widely used in various applications due to its versatility, performance, and availability of development tools. It has `32KB of flash memory` for program storage, `2KB of SRAM` for data storage, and various I/O ports for interfacing with external devices.

•**A 7-segment** display is a simple electronic component used to represent numeric digits and some basic symbols. It consists of seven individual `LED (Light Emitting Diode)` segments arranged in a specific pattern to form the digit representation from 0 to 9 and a few letters `(A, B, C, D, E, F)` as well. These displays are widely used in various electronic devices, from digital clocks and calculators to microwave ovens and scoreboard displays,such 4 segments were attached.
